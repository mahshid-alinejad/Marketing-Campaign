# Importance of Splitting Data Before Encoding

Splitting the data into training and testing sets before applying any form of encoding or transformation is a crucial step in building a robust machine learning model. This practice is primarily about avoiding data leakage and ensuring a valid evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data. Here are the key reasons why data should be split before encoding:

## 1. Preventing Data Leakage
Data leakage occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model. This can happen if transformations such as encoding, normalization, or scaling are applied before the data is split into training and testing sets. For example, if you use one-hot encoding or feature scaling on the entire dataset, the transformations incorporate knowledge from the entire dataset, including the test set. This might lead to overoptimistic performance estimates during model validation and poorer performance when the model is deployed in a real-world setting, as the model may have inadvertently learned patterns specific to the test data.

## 2. Simulating Real-world Scenarios
In practice, a model will encounter new, previously unseen data. By splitting the data first and then applying transformations such as encoding separately to training and test datasets, you mimic the real-world scenario where the model must make predictions on data that was not used during the training process. This helps in validating how well your model generalizes to new data.

## 3. Maintaining Distribution Integrity
Encoding (especially techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target encoding) can alter the distribution of data. If encoding is done before splitting the data, the statistical properties of the encoding process may not accurately reflect the natural distribution of the data in a training or testing scenario. By splitting first, you ensure that the encoding reflects the training data's properties, preserving the natural variance and biases of the data as they would occur in a live environment.

## 4. Validating Model Robustness
When you encode data after splitting, you can validate that your model's preprocessing steps (including encoding) are robust and work well with unseen data. This step is crucial for assessing the model's stability and reliability.

### How to Implement Proper Splitting and Encoding:
Hereâ€™s a typical workflow in a machine learning pipeline to ensure correct practices:
- **Split the Data**: Divide your data into a training set and a testing set.
- **Apply Encodings and Transformations**: Only now should you apply encoding and other transformations to the training data.
- **Transform the Test Data**: Apply the same transformations to the test data using parameters or models derived from the training data. For example, use the same encoders for categorical data, scale using the same mean and standard deviation, etc.
