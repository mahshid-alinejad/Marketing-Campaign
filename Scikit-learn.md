# Scikit-learn Main Areas

Scikit-learn is a popular Python library used in machine learning, providing a range of tools for various tasks. Here are its main functionalities:

## 1. Supervised Learning
These algorithms learn from labeled data:
- **Classification**: Predicts categorical labels. Includes SVM, Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.
- **Regression**: Predicts continuous values. Includes Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Trees, etc.

## 2. Unsupervised Learning
Algorithms for data without labeled responses:
- **Clustering**: Groups similar objects. Examples include K-Means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces the number of variables. Includes PCA, Feature Selection, and Non-negative Matrix Factorization.

## 3. Model Selection and Evaluation
Tools for choosing models and assessing performance:
- **Cross-validation**: Assesses predictive performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizes model parameters with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
- **Metrics**: Evaluates models with accuracy, precision, recall, AUC-ROC, etc.

## 4. Preprocessing
Methods for data preparation:
- **Data Transformation**: Includes scaling, centering, normalization, and binarization.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts features from raw data.
- **Imputation of Missing Values**: Handles missing data in datasets.

## 5. Ensemble Methods
Combines multiple estimators to improve robustness:
- **Boosting**: Combines multiple weak models into a strong learner.
- **Bagging**: Builds multiple models from different subsamples of the dataset.
- **Random Forests**: An ensemble of decision trees, typically trained via bagging.

## 6. Feature Selection
Selects the most relevant features for the task:
- Techniques include Recursive Feature Elimination, Feature Importance Evaluation, and SelectFromModel.

## 7. Pipeline
Chains estimators into one sequence:
- Useful for fixed sequences of steps in data processing, like feature selection followed by normalization, then learning.

Scikit-learn's comprehensive suite of functionalities makes it versatile and efficient for modeling and evaluating complex datasets.
